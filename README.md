# vuejs-todo
todo application using Vue Js

## Introduction
 `Vue` is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

**Getting Started with Vue**
The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>` but most of the development uses CLI `VUE-CLI v3`. VUE-CLI  is an awesome tool for generating and building Vue app. It includes Babel, Typescript, ESlint, PostCss and more. It include dev server with hot reload and Vue UI tool to manage your app in graphical interface. [Read More about Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
